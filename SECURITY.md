# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Supported versions include Red v3 and higher. Red v2 and lower are end of life. And will not receive security updates of any kind. If you are using v2 we recommend you upgrade to v3.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We ask that you report vulnerabilities over at **[TBD]**

We accept vulnerabilities that exist in the code base as seen on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cog-creators/red-discordbot), 3rd party add-ons/cogs or the usage of the development commands (Such as ``debug`` or ``repl``) are not considered vulnerabilities that we accept.

Examples of acceptable vulnerabilities:
* An exploit or bug whereby the token is leaked.
* An exploit or bug whereby data that's stored on the bot is leaked.
* An exploit whereby it crashes the bot.

If you're reporting a vulnerability for a 3rd party add-on/cog please try to get in contact with its creator. To help you find the creator you can use the bot command ``findcog``.

We will investigate the reported vulnerability and report back on its status when we're able to do so. If the vulnerability is accepted we will open a new security advisory on GitHub.
We may invite you as the reporter to collaborate on a fix with us if its deemed necessary. 
Once the advisory is published and a fix has been deployed we will announce the advisory over our usual update channels.

Thank you.
